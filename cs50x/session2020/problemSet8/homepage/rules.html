            <li>The players or teams start on opposite sides of the net. One player is designated the server, and the opposing player is the receiver.</li>
            <li> The choice to be server or receiver in the first game and the choice of ends is decided by a coin toss before the warm-up starts. Service alternates game by game between the two players or teams.</li>
            <li> For each point, the server starts behind the baseline, between the center mark and the sideline. The receiver may start anywhere on their side of the net.</li>
            <li> When the receiver is ready, the server will serve, although the receiver must play to the pace of the server.</li>
