        <dl>
            <dt>Game</dt>
            <dd>A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as "love", "15", "30", and "40", respectively.</dd>
        
            <dt>Set</dt>
            <dd>A set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games, ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria. Typically, a player wins a set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent. If one player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game is played.</dd>
        
            <dt>Match</dt>
            <dd>A match consists of a sequence of sets. The outcome is determined through a best of three or five sets system. The first player to win two sets in a best-of-three, or three sets in a best-of-five, wins the match.</dd>
