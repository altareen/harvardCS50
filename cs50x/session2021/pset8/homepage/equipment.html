        <h2 id="equipify">An Overview of the Tennis Equipment</h2>
        
        <p>Part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play. Beginners need only a racket and balls.</p>
        
        <h3 id="racketify">Rackets</h3>
        
        <p>The components of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings.</p>
        
        <h3 id="ballify">Balls</h3>
        
        <p>Tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size, weight, deformation, and bounce to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as 65.41–68.58 mm (2.575–2.700 in). Balls must weigh between 56.0 and 59.4 g (1.98 and 2.10 oz).</p>
